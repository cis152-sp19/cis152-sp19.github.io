    <h2>About Airborne</h2>
    <p> Parrots and other domestic birds are the fourth most popular animal companion after dogs, cats, and fish. The human-bird bond can be so strong that people often think of parrots as their children! Parrots and other domestic birds can learn how to talk and communicate verballe with their owners. Unfortunately, many birds are inadequately cared for because their humans do not understand how to train them. This leads to the relinqueshment of birds to shelters. This is unfortunate, because birds are a source of great joy if cared for properly! </p>
    <p><a href="Airborne%20Birds.html"> Airborne Bird Rescue Association</a> rehomes and cares for lost, rescued, or surrendered birds in their network of foster homes and shelters. They have helped thousands of homeless birds find loving human families. In addition to rehoming avians, Airborne also provides education and resources for bird care and proper training so that new bird owners can share a fulfilling bond with their pets.</p>
