          <h2>A little history...</h2>
    <p>Donut Delights was started in 1971 by Melvin Furballski, an immigrant baker from the far east coast of Poland. Known far and wide for his delicate pastries, Melvin fled his homeland in search of a better life for his family. In 1970 he landed in New York City and by chance he found an open seat on a bus heading west. When an unexpected mechanical failure forced a three day delay in Champaign, Illinois, Furballski saw the need for a donut shop, so he decided to stay and make a new life for himself in Urbana, Illinois. With only one hundred dollarsto his name, he found an abandoned breadshop and within two days he had one of a kind donuts flying off the racks faster than he could bake them and things have never slowed down. Now you can find that same great donut recipe plus dozens more still being made with the samelove and care as when Donut Delights first opened.A bakery fire in the mid-1980s destroyed many of the shop's records...but NOT THE RECIPES. While many people might have viewed the fire as an excuse to quit, Melvin instead used it as anopportunity to reconfigure the interior design, allowing him to add the coffee roastery section as well. So when you visit, be prepared for the inviting mix of aromas from fresh-roasted coffee beans and fresh-baked donuts: It's the closest thing to "Breakfast Heaven" anywhere in the C-U area!</p>

    <p>Mr. Furballski decided on the logo because 15 years ago his great great grandfather who started the business with a small 5 million dollar loan created many different variations of the logo for the company. Samuel furballski, decided on the logo that hangs from the building today. It wasn’t until recent Melvin wanted to change accent colors and decide a theme for the business. You can see a picture of Melvin’s great grandfather’s picture hanging in the donut shop still today to remind Melvin how hard he has worked and his ancestors have worked to get where they are today. Melvin released information in a newsletter <a href="contactus.html" >(Subscribe Here)</a> that stocks for donutshop delights will be going public as of 5/10/2019. Grab as many stocks as you can! This company is only soaring as far as popularity goes. Mevlin has 42 employees working around the clock making fresh products as well as serves an estimated 87% of CU every year! That’s an estimated 76066 people every single year! </p>
    
    <p>In 1974 Mevlin had just got out of high school and was drafted into the war. He fought for his country from 1974 to 1980. He then came back to the united states to find a family and continue to run the family business. Because of this Melvin has great respect for veterans because he’s one himself. Veterans always eat free. He understands how hard and how important veterans service is, so he wants to give back to the community by serving the veterans just like they served for us.</p>
