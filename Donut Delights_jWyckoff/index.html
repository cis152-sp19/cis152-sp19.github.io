                <h2>Our History:</h2>
                <p>
                <br>
                    
                Due to a fire that no longer existed, and the special reciepies of Mr. Melvin Furballski, our original history was lost. In this world things seem to have gone quite well as nothing like the fire Mr. Melvin Furballski claims altered things has happened here. In this time line, a certain hobbiest who met Mr. Melvin Furballski named Marie Falcon convinced him to share some of his non reality altering recepies in order to provide the local community some joy. He reluctantly agreed to use his uncanny knowledge to help her, and has been the head of the Proposals Division ever since. 
                    <br> <br>
                For her part, Marie Falcon has greatly enjoyed the success of the business, even tweaking some of the recipies herself to include things such as the more savory goods like scones and cream horns. Her son, Samuel Falcon, was appointed CEO due to her dislike of technology and Mr. Melvin Furballski's outright avoidance of it and tax returns. Even so, as since 1955, she truly runs the kitchens and the baking schedules.
