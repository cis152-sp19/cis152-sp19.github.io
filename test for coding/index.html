<h3>Digital Arts</h3>
    
    <p>I am currently tyring to get a degree in Animation so I am attending <a href="https://www.parkland.edu/">Parkland College, Champaign, Illinois</a>. There I am working my way to get my Digital Arts Degree.<a href="https://www.parkland.edu/Main/Academics/Departments/Business-Computer-Science-Technologies/Areas-of-Study/Computer-Science-Programs/Digital-Media">Parkland Digital arts</a></p>

    <li> There they teach us how
        <strong>
            
            <code>to use blockquote</code>
            
        </strong>, they also teach us how to use </li>

        <li><strong>
            <code>ul(with li),</code>
            
            </strong></li>
 
        
    <li>
        <strong>
            <code>ol(with li)</code>
            
        </strong>.Along with how to using coding techinques like</li>
        
    <li><code>
        
        <strong>cite</strong>
        
        </code>
        
        which let us use citations.One of the classes I take is a Digital media class were learning 3d modeling and how put</li> 
        
    <li><strong><code> img</code></strong> into programs like maya. </li>
        

    <li>In my coding classes we learned a shortcut for quoting which is
        <strong>
        <code>q</code>
        </strong>. </li>

    <li>  We also learned how to use different coding methods like
        <strong>
            
            <code>address</code>
            
        </strong>
        
         which is to help code contact information, </li>
   
    <li>
        <strong>
            
        <code>abbr</code>
        </strong>which is used for abrivations,</li>
    <li>
        <strong>
        
        <code>small</code>
        
        </strong> 
        
        which lets the user code things in fine print like footnotes and</li>
        
    <li><strong><code>br</code></strong>
    
    which lets you start a new line of text.
    Parkland is a really great place that has helped me devleop my animation skills much better than before. I am now more capable and confident in how to make a animation then I was previously going into to it.</li></ol></section>

    <p>For me personally. I was born in Springfield but then moved to Champaign, IL. There while grooing up I had watched a lot of cartoons and anime. That was when I found my first calling for Animation.Over the course of my life i then started practicing and learning more and more about animation. Starting first with making my own comic series which was stated above. AFter that I then got into digital arts. To presue this goal I then went to 
        
    <strong>
        
    <em>The HighSchool of Saint Thomas More</em>
        
        </strong>.Where we learned to animate. after I graduated I then came to parkland where i am currently trying to Digital Arts Degree. I hope to graduate and start making my own shows and maybe be able to attend a college in California which offers intership with you
