		<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
		<p>In my free time, I like to play <dfn>video games</dfn> which is "any of various interactive games played using a specialized electronic gaming device or a computer or mobile device and a television or other display screen, along with a means to control graphic images." (<cite><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/video-game">dictionary.com</a></cite>). <!--that is right I gave a defintion on video games.-->  Mostly I enjoy playing video games with my Dad, my brother, and my friends on Xbox or Steam.</p>
		<p>I also like to sketch random things, although I don't have much time to do it these days. I do sometimes get to sketch on a piece of paper. </p>
		
		<p>Some of my favorite games are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Minecraft</li>
			<li>Warframe</li>
			<li>Fallout 3</li>
			<li>Legend of Zelda Ocarina of <strong>time</strong></li>
			<li>Titan<sub>fall</sub> 2</li>
		</ul>

        </figure>
        <figcaption>Skyrim is a single player game. Portal 2 is really fun with a second person. Halo Reach is fun with four or more players.</figcaption>
		<p>Finally, I enjoy the time I get to spend with my family and friends outside of playing video games. </p>

	<p><sup>1</sup>I highly recommend CCHS if you're looking for a cat or dog.  Catsnap is another way to find a cat.</p>
	<p><sup>2</sup>You may be more likely to find me walking the halls of D-wing or working in D019, but the point is that you can stop and chat, unless I'm in a class, of course.</p>
